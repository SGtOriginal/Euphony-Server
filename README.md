# Euphony-Server
READ LICENSE FIRST BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE

Euphony Server is a part of the bigger program called Euphony which aims to provide music right at your desktop without any pesky ads or loss of sound quality. All it requires is internet for serving the songs (depends on if you have listened to the song before using Euphony Server and if the database remains intact).

# Features
* Easy setup without any account system (and hence no backup system in place).
* Privacy based (We never have and never will collect any information on you. YouTube and pther sources may log your ip when the music is being downloaded but that can be solved with a good proxy/vpn/tor)
* Open source (so people can always improve the project)
* YouTube support (more yet to come)
* FREE (Most important point :) )

# Some (Probably) Important Info
Euphony Client is not required for this. It just starts a Flask server which serves the music to your localhost. For personal use, Euphony Client is recommended. For public use, like in your community, then this is good enough for you.

# How To Use
## I assume that you have Python 3 ##
If you don't have Python 3, then follow these steps:

* If you are using Windows, then download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31010/ (and run it of course)
* If you are using Linux, then do 'apt-get install python3 python3-pip'
* If you are using Mac, then download it https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31010/ (and run it of course)

## I also assume that you have ffmpeg ##
If you don't have ffmpeg, then follow these steps:

* If you are using Windows, then Euphony automatically downloads it for you.
* If you are using Linux or Mac, go to https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ffmpeg/ (They write a better method of ffmpeg installation than me.)

### Steps ###

1. Click on the green `<> Code` button.
2. Click `Download zip`.
3. Extract the downloaded zip.
4. Open a terminal in the extracted folder.
5. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Wait for the previous command to finish.
7. Run `python main.py`. If that does not work, run `python3 main.py`
